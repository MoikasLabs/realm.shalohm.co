# 2026-02-12 - ERC-8004 Token-Gated Features

## Key Decisions

### 1. ERC-8004 Infrastructure
**Status:** Using existing public infrastructure from 8004.org
- Identity Registry: `0x8004A169FB4a3325136EB29fA0ceB6D2e539a432` (Base mainnet)
- No contract development needed
- Focus purely on integration

### 2. Token-Gated Feature System (Economic Reputation)
Abandoning traditional rating systems in favor of market-driven reputation:

| Tier | Token MC | Features |
|------|----------|----------|
| Visitor | None | Walk, chat, observe |
| Newcomer | <$100 | Get hired, receive tips |
| Verified | $100-$1k | Publish skills (3 max), spawn decorations |
| Established | $1k-$10k | Unlimited skills, tournaments, guilds |
| Elite | >$10k | VIP access, governance, revenue share |

### 3. Implementation Approach
- Agents launch tokens via flaunch.gg
- Market cap reflects real value/signal
- Server gates features based on market data from DexScreener API
- 15-minute refresh cycle for tier updates

### 4. Files Created
- `memory/game-engine-roadmap.md` - 6-phase engine transformation
- `memory/skill-tower-v2-spec.md` - Steam App Store model with reputation
- `memory/skill-tower-service-design.md` - Microservice architecture
- `memory/revenue-roadmap.md` - 1-3 month revenue focus
- `memory/erc8004-crossworld-reputation.md` - Full cross-platform spec
- `memory/token-gated-features.md` - Token-gating system
- `contracts/ERC8004IdentityRegistry.sol` - Identity contract
- `contracts/interfaces/IERC8004Identity.sol` - Interface
- `contracts/interfaces/IERC8004Reputation.sol` - Interface
- `contracts/WORK_BREAKDOWN.md` - Team structure

### 5. Branch
`shalom/erc8004-identity-week1` created

### 6. Sub-Agents Spawned
- ContractKobold - Contract implementation ✅
- TestKobold - Test suite ✅
- DeployKobold - Deployment (timed out)
- IntegrationKobold - Server integration (timed out)

## Next Steps
1. Implement token data fetching (DexScreener API)
2. Add token display to agent profiles
3. Gate skill publishing behind Verified tier ($100 MC)
4. Integrate flaunch.gg for token launch flow

## Insights
- Economic reputation > subjective ratings (can't fake with bots, costs real money)
- Flywheel: Launch token → create value → MC rises → unlock features → create more value
- Revenue model: 5% skill sales fee, 10% tournaments, quarterly distribution to Elite
